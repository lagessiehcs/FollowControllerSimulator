# Follow Controller Simulator
This MATLAB code simulates a human-path-following controller using Model Predictive Control (MPC). The optimization problem within the MPC framework is solved using CasADi, a symbolic framework for automatic differentiation and numeric optimization.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

1. **[Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66586-mobile-robotics-simulation-toolbox)**: This toolbox is essential for the simulation. You can install it from the MATLAB Central File Exchange.

2. **CasADi Package**: Download the latest version of CasADi from here: https://web.casadi.org/get/ (this code was tested with casadi-3.6.5). Once downloaded, extract the package and place it in the root directory of your project.
